for powerup mask{

        set anchor point for sprite in the middle of the body.
        create another node that sits on top of the sprite at that point.
        sprite will create visibility of sharks in a circle radius of 2x the sprite.
            this will happen by changing the hidden bool of the shark and powerups.
}



for powerup sharkbomb{

will use removefrom scene.
might flash an explosion or something.


}



when changing between scenes, you're going to need to set up a transition, how the scene will change to the next and define which scene you want to transition to.

For the transition,

var transition:SKTransition = SKTransition.fadeWithDuration(1)
The fadeWithDurationcan be replaced with any SKTransition a list of which can be found in the documentation https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/SpriteKit/Reference/SKTransition_Ref/index.html

as for defining the scene,

var scene:SKScene = GameScene(size: self.size)
You're stating which scene you wish to transition to, in this case GameScene, but should be replaced with whichever scene you wish to transition to.

In order to start the transition, call:

self.view?.presentScene(scene, transition: transition)
Which will move to the scene scene which was set up in the line prior, using the transition transition which was also defined.
